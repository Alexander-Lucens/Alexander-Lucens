## 🧠 About Me

I’m a software engineer with a strong interest in backend architecture, building reliable APIs, and developing full-stack applications.

Most of my learning comes from **project-based environments** such as 42 Berlin and RS School — where you solve real problems, collaborate, and work under pressure.

Right now I’m focused on:

- improving backend engineering skills  
- building production-style projects  
- learning AI step-by-step (without hype — focusing on fundamentals)

## 💻 Tech Stack

**Backend:** Node.js, NestJS, Express, REST APIs\n 
**Databases:** MongoDB (Mongoose), PostgreSQL\n
**Frontend:** React, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS\n
**Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, C, basic C++, Python, SQL\n
**Tools:** Git, Docker (basics)\n

## 🧠 AI (Learning Journey)

I’m gradually exploring AI and GenAI — focusing on understanding tools first, then building better projects.

As part of that journey I built:

### 🧩 Deal Research Agent (prototype)
*A small experimental agent using OpenAI API — created as a test assignment.*

Not perfect — but a useful step for understanding:

- API integrations  
- prompts & automation flows  
- practical limitations

I plan to rebuild it later with better architecture and cleaner results.
